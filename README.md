# CAPTCHA-Your-Attention

## Welcome to the Anti-Doomscrolling Revolution!

Are you tired of endlessly scrolling through shorts and losing track of time? Do you need a friendly nudge to remind you that there's a world outside your screen? Look no further! **CAPTCHA-Your-Attention** is here to save your sanity and your productivity.

## Features

### üß† Brainrot Prevention
- **Math CAPTCHAs**: Solve simple (or not-so-simple) math problems to prove you're not a robot and to give your brain a quick workout.
- **Difficulty Levels**: The more you scroll, the harder the CAPTCHAs get. It's like a video game, but with math!

### ‚è±Ô∏è Customizable Intervals
- **CAPTCHA Interval**: Set how often you want to be interrupted by a CAPTCHA. Choose from "every few seconds" to "just when you thought you were safe."
- **Difficulty Increase**: Decide how quickly the difficulty ramps up. Perfect for those who love a challenge or just want to feel like they're back in school.

### üìä Stats Tracking
- **Total Shorts Scrolled**: Keep track of how many shorts you've scrolled through. Warning: the number might shock you.
- **Time Spent Watching**: See how many precious seconds (or hours) you've spent watching shorts.
- **CAPTCHAs Solved**: Show off your CAPTCHA-solving prowess.
- **Scrolled Distance**: Measure the distance you've scrolled. Who knew your thumb could travel so far?
